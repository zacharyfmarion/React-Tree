# Node

```js
import { Node } from 'react-svg-tree';
```

## Basic Node

A node is essentially an svg `circle`. All props supported by circle are supported by the node. Node that the x and y props are overriden by the formatting algorithm and should not be set in the render method.

<Playground>
  <svg viewBox='0 0 20 20' style={{height: 100}}>
    <Node id="A" x={10} y={10} r={10} fill="teal" />
  </svg>
</Playground>

## With Label

A node is essentially an svg `circle`. All props supported by circle are supported by the node. Node that the x and y props are overriden by the formatting algorithm and should not be set in the render method.

<Playground>
  <svg viewBox='0 0 20 20' style={{height: 100}}>
    <Node id="A" x={10} y={10} r={10} fill="teal" showLabel />
  </svg>
</Playground>


## Custom svg content

You can pass in a custom svg into node and have that be rendered instead of the default circle.

<Playground>
  <svg viewBox='0 0 20 20' style={{height: 100}}>
    <Node id="A" x={10} y={10}>
      <rect width={20} height={20} stroke="red" />
    </Node>
  </svg>
</Playground>
