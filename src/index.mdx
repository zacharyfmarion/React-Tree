# react-svg-tree

<TreeDemo />

The `react-svg-tree` renders an svg tree from a data structure of nodes. It can also optionally render the tree from children that are provided at render. The package exposes two components, `Tree` and `Node`, which are documented on their respective pages. Feel free to click on the nodes in the demo above to see its functionality.

## Basic Usage

```js
import { Tree } from 'react-svg-tree';

const vertexMap = new Map([
  [0, [1, 2, 3]],
  [1, [4, 5]],
  [2, []],
  [3, [6]],
  [4, []],
  [5, []],
  [6, []],
]);

const App = () => (
  <Tree
    width={200}
    height={150}
    rootId={0}
    vertices={vertexMap}
    showLabels={true}
  />
);
```
